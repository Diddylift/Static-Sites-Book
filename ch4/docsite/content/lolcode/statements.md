### Expression Statements

A bare expression (e.g. a function call or math operation), without any assignment, is a legal statement in LOLCODE. Aside from any side-effects from the expression when evaluated, the final value is placed in the temporary variable `IT`. `IT`'s value remains in local scope and exists until the next time it is replaced with a bare expression.

### Assignment Statements

Assignment statements have no side effects with `IT`. They are generally of the form:

```
<variable> <assignment operator> <expression>
```

The variable being assigned may be used in the expression.

### Flow Control Statements

Flow control statements cover multiple lines and are described in the following section.
